                <p>
                    You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping
                    trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why
                    I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop
                    until I become the Web Development Hero.

                    I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any
                    simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make
                    simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn
                    advanced topics.

                        I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know
                        everything needed to make a website function, efficient.
                        I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most
                        popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know
                        the deployment, server and security. I will give you
                        100% web solution.

                        They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a
                        remove web developer. I made their website and showed it
                        to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was
                        fun working at Programming Hero.
